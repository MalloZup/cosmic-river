# Rationale:

Cosmic river has been designed with the aim of ensuring that it satisfies the requirements of both application developers as well as toolmakers for Github based events.
Cosmic-river will collect all the GitHub events and dispatch them to specific clients.
The clients can react by the events with specific handlers.

Also tool/application developers will have an universal API on events, where they can bind their application without any development cost.

Note that by by its universality, cosmic-river can be applied in different domains. 
It can be applied in all domains where event-driven automation based on GitHub make sense.

As example consider this use-case:

  Release automation:
 * you can watch a specific issue beeing closed, cosmic-river server will notify the cosmic-river clients, which will perform custom actions.

 * consider  the https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes publish a new release, cosmic-river can trigger automatically the needed automation for making a new package for your distro, testing it with your tool

  Testing, CI, Automation:
 * automation on  Pull-Requests, etc.

  Event Notifications:
 * get notified with an Issue is closed, or any other particular event occurs.

  Team Metrics/Events:
 * you could trigger specific actions/workflows, or simply gather data thanks to specifics events

### Layout of repo:

This repository contains basically two clojure projects.

- cosmic-river (server)
- criver-client

Cosmic-river server aims to distribute the GitHub events to the message-brokers.

The criver-clients will consume these events, filtering them and triggering the automation needed.
